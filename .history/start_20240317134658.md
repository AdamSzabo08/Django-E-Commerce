# Exlanations:

python -m venv envivorment: This command creates a virtual environment named 'envivorment' using Python's built-in venv module. A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to install packages without affecting the system-wide Python installation.

ls: This command lists the files and directories in the current directory. It's typically used in Unix-based systems like Linux or macOS. In Windows, you can use dir instead.

envivorment/Scripts/activate: This command activates the virtual environment named 'envivorment'. Activating a virtual environment sets up the environment variables and modifies the shell's prompt to indicate that you are now working within the virtual environment.

pip install virtualenv: This command installs the virtualenv package globally on your system. Virtualenv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments similar to the venv module but with more features and flexibility.

pip install django: This command installs the Django web framework, which is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

pip install django-rest-framework: This command installs Django REST framework, a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and more.

pip install django-cors-headers: This command installs Django CORS headers, a Django application for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers. CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

pip install djoser: This command installs Djoser, a Django package that provides a set of Django Rest Framework views to handle basic actions such as registration, login, logout, password reset, etc., for your Django REST API.

pip install pillow: This command installs Pillow, a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

pip install stripe: This command installs the Stripe Python library, which provides convenient access to the Stripe API for processing payments and managing customer data.

django-admin startproject my_webshop: This command creates a new Django project named 'my_webshop'. It generates the basic directory structure and configuration files for a Django project, including settings.py, urls.py, and wsgi.py.
